AirBnB clone

## Project Description

- A command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects. The main purpose is to create all classes for AirBnB(`User`, `City`, `Place...) that inherit from a `BaseModel, create a class that takes care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of instances, an
abstracted storage engine, and unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

## How to use

### In interactive mode

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```
### In non-interactive mode

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

a dictionary and save it to the storage engine.

`models/city.py, amenity.py, place.py, review.py, state.py, user.py` - These are the different entities that inherit from `base_model.py` and are used each for a different purpose as their name suggests. More information is provided in each module.
